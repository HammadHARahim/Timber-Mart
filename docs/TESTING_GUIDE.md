## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**Issue**: Server won't start
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
sudo systemctl status postgresql

# Check if port 5001 is available
lsof -i :5001

# Check environment variables
cat backend/.env
```

**Issue**: Admin user not created
```bash
# Check database
psql -U hammadharahim -d timber_mart_dev
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin';

# If not exists, check server logs for errors
```

**Issue**: JWT token invalid
```bash
# Verify JWT_SECRET in backend/.env
# Default: your-secret-key-change-in-production
```

### Frontend Issues

**Issue**: Login fails
- Check backend is running on port 5001
- Check `frontend/.env` has correct API URL
- Open browser console for error messages
- Verify credentials are correct

**Issue**: User Management page blank
- Open browser console
- Check for CORS errors
- Verify token is in sessionStorage
- Check user has ADMIN role

**Issue**: Cannot create users
