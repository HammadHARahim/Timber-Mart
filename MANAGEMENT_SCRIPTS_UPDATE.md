## Configuration

All scripts use centralized configuration:

# Port Configuration
BACKEND_PORT=5001
FRONTEND_PORT=5173

# Health Check
BACKEND_HEALTH_URL="http://localhost:${BACKEND_PORT}/api/health"
MAX_RETRIES=30
RETRY_DELAY=1

# Force Mode (stop.sh)
FORCE_MODE=false  # Use --force flag to enable
```

To change ports, edit these variables in each script.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Services Won't Start
1. Check status: `./status.sh`
2. View logs: `tail -f logs/backend.log logs/frontend.log`
3. Force stop: `./stop.sh --force`
4. Start again: `./start.sh`

### Services Won't Stop
1. Try force mode: `./stop.sh --force`
2. Manual cleanup: `lsof -ti:5001 5173 | xargs kill -9`
3. Check status: `./status.sh`

### Port Conflicts
```bash
# Check what's using the port
lsof -i :5001
lsof -i :5173

# Force stop
./stop.sh --force

# Start again
./start.sh
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended
1. Test the new scripts:
   ```bash

   ./stop.sh        # Stop gracefully
   ```

2. Try development mode:
   ```bash
   ./start-dev.sh   # Opens separate terminals
   ```

3. Review the documentation:
   - [SCRIPTS_README.md](SCRIPTS_README.md) - Complete script documentation
   - This file - Update summary

### Optional Enhancements

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All old usage patterns still work:
```bash
./start.sh          # Still works
./start-dev.sh      # Still works
./stop.sh           # Still works (now with more features)
```

✅ New features are opt-in:
```bash
./stop.sh --force   # New feature
./status.sh         # New script
```

✅ No breaking changes to existing workflows

## Performance Impact

- **Startup Time:** +3-5 seconds (due to health checks)
- **Stop Time:** +0-5 seconds (due to graceful shutdown)
- **Memory:** Negligible (bash scripts)
- **CPU:** Negligible (bash scripts)

The slight time increase is worth it for the reliability and safety improvements.
